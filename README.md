# MPOS System

**Empower Your Business, Simplify Every Transaction**

## Introduction

The MPOS (Modern Point of Sale) System is a robust and intuitive solution designed to streamline business transactions, manage inventory, and automate various customer-related tasks. This system is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses that seek to enhance operational efficiency and improve customer service.

The MPOS System is built on a reliable LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and offers a smooth interface for client devices, facilitating seamless interactions with hardware like barcode scanners and receipt printers. This documentation outlines the system's architecture, installation, usage, risks, and available solutions.

## Features
- Transaction Processing: Process sales and payments efficiently.
- Inventory Management: Track stock levels and reorder products.
- Customer Management: Store and manage customer information for future interactions.
- Reporting: Generate sales and inventory reports for business insights.
- Multi-user Access: Manage user roles and permissions for secure usage.


## Installation

To get started with the MPOS System, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/keithgabriel/Project-MVP.git
   cd Project-MVP
   ```

2. Set up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on your server or local machine.

3. Configure the database:
   - Create a MySQL database for the POS system.
   - Import the `mpos.sql` file provided in the repository to set up the database structure.

4. Update the database connection in `config.php` with your database credentials:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USER', 'your-username');
   define('DB_PASS', 'your-password');
   define('DB_NAME', 'mpos');
   ```

5. Start the Apache server:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   sudo systemctl start mysql
   ```

6. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost/mpos` to access the system.

## Usage

### Infrastructure Requirements:
- **Server**: A server running a LAMP stack to manage backend operations.
- **Database**: MySQL to store transaction data, inventory, and user information.
- **Client Machines**: Devices with the POS client application, interacting with hardware like barcode scanners and receipt printers.
- **Network**: A secure local network (LAN) or cloud-based connection for real-time synchronization.

### Workflow:
- **Login**: Each user logs in with a unique username and password.
- **Sales**: Process transactions using barcode scanners and printers.
- **Inventory**: Keep track of stock levels and update products.
- **Reports**: Generate sales reports and monitor performance.

## Risks and Challenges
1. **Data Security**: Ensure secure handling of sensitive data like transactions and customer information.
2. **System Downtime**: Risk of business disruption during technical failures or upgrades.
3. **Network Latency**: For cloud-based solutions, the need for reliable internet can be a challenge in areas with poor connectivity.

## Existing Solutions
There are several existing POS systems like Square, Vend, and Shopify POS, but MPOS focuses on providing a cost-effective, open-source solution for businesses with specific requirements.
